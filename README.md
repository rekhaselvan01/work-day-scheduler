# work-day-scheduler
The work-day-scheduler is designed using html, css and moment and jquery.
It is pretty simple application in which the page loads with the time block for work hours.
the date is displayed on the top of the calendar.
when scrolled the time blocks are presented.
The timeblocks are color coded to indicate if the time is present, past or future.
If any event is clicked and values are changed, the application will save the values in local storage and render it on page load.
